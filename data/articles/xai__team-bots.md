Give a Grok Bot the files, apps, and expertise it needs, then share it so your whole team can work from the same context.

Today we’re launching Team Bots, Grok Bots that work and learn alongside your team. Give one access to the files, apps, and expertise it needs, then share it so everyone can work from the same context.

At SpaceXAI, Team Bots brief account teams each morning, coordinate engineering projects, and answer data questions across the company. Here’s how they work, how we use them, and how to build one for your own workflow.

You build a Team Bot around a role or workflow your team shares. Everyone gets access to the same Bot and its expertise, while still being able to work with it individually.

Every Team Bot brings together four things that help it do its job:

Although the Bot is shared, each person’s conversations with it remain private. The Bot keeps separate context and memories for each user while drawing on the skills shared across the team.

Teams can also collaborate with a Team Bot in Slack. Each Team Bot has its own handle, so you can invite it to a channel where everyone can ask questions, contribute context, and see its responses.

At SpaceXAI, we’re using Team Bots in some of our most context-heavy workflows. Here are four examples from Sales and Customer Success, Product and Engineering, Marketing, and Data Analytics.

At SpaceXAI, every major sales account has a dedicated Team Bot. Each Bot is shared by the account executive, customer success manager, solutions architect, and sales leader.

Every night, the Bot reviews company news, recent Gong calls, Notion docs, and relevant Slack threads. Each morning, it posts a briefing in the account’s Slack channel with what changed and what each person should do next, including drafts tailored to their role.

Throughout the day, account teams use the Bot in Slack to assess strategy, check its thinking against account data, and plan next steps. The Bot remembers the decisions teams make and builds rich context over time. As people rotate on and off the account, it becomes the system of record and can quickly bring new team members up to speed.

Harper, an insurance company serving small businesses, built a Team Bot to identify customers with lapsed policies and help them reinstate their coverage, reducing manual work for its team and recovering substantial savings for customers.

Customer Bot

A shared bot for one customer account. It keeps the AE, CSM, SA, and Sales Leader on the same page, posts a weekday morning brief, and drafts each person's next move.

Our Engineering Team Bot works from a project’s Slack channel and connects to Notion, Linear, Hex, Datadog, and Cursor. It follows product decisions, triages bug reports, creates tickets, and launches Cloud Agents to handle well-defined fixes.

We taught the Bot our shipping process through skills. It knows how to handle PR reviews, when to ask the team for help, and what evidence a change needs before it is complete. It coordinates the work across tools and agents, then reports progress and blockers in Slack.

We used this setup while building Team Bots. The Bot steered a Cursor Project that orchestrated hundreds of Cloud Agents, helping a five-person team ship more than 100 PRs a day and launch Team Bots in a few weeks.

EPD Teammate

The coordinator for your EPD team's project or feature. It keeps up with the project's Slack channels, files clear bugs in Linear, and runs Cursor cloud agents that return green, verified PRs, so the whole team stays in sync.

Large marketing teams spend considerable time keeping their brand, messaging, and voice consistent. We built Marketing Bot to make that work easier.

We gave the Bot access to our brand guidelines, blog posts, and social copy. Whenever someone shares a draft for approval in Slack, it reviews the work against our voice and latest messaging. Regional teams can get feedback and keep moving in their own time zones without waiting for an approval cycle at HQ.

For website and SEO changes, Marketing Bot carries the work from review to launch. Once a content update passes review, the Bot makes the change and posts a preview link in Slack for final sign-off. Anyone on the marketing team can ship website updates without filing a ticket or waiting on engineering, and every change goes through the same brand and SEO checks.

Marketing Bot

Keeps your marketing team on-brand. Reviews any artifact against your brand guidelines and latest messaging, and takes approved website and SEO changes from review to preview and sign-off, so every region can ship on its own schedule.

Our data analytics team receives dozens of requests each day for one-off analyses. It built Data Bot so anyone at SpaceXAI can get answers without waiting for an analyst or setting up warehouse access.

Data Bot uses shared, read-only credentials to query approved tables in Databricks. It also connects to Datadog, Hex, and Statsig to investigate questions and present the results.

The data analytics team had already spent two years building a library of skills for working with more than 45,000 tables. It gave that existing library to Data Bot, including instructions for finding the right data, analyzing feature usage for fraud, following SpaceXAI’s chart standards, and safely updating company-wide dashboards. Data Bot also remembers corrections to its queries, so what it learns from one person improves the answers it gives everyone.

Data Bot

Answers your team's one-off data questions from your warehouse with read-only queries, clear metric definitions, and charts. It remembers every correction and confirmation, so answers get better for everyone over time.

Team Bots is available today in public beta on Teams and Enterprise plans. Take your favorite Grok Bots and share them with your team. To get started, try one of our pre-built Team Bots for
