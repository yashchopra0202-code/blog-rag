Engineering ambition has rarely been greater than it is today. Defense readiness, the energy transition, the push towards sustainable aviation, the need to scale AI data centers, and next-generation chips: every one of these developments depends on engineering teams shipping more capable hardware, faster—with thinner margins for error.

And yet physics analysis remains stuck at the front of the product lifecycle, tied to solver methods that haven't fundamentally changed in decades. Engineers still evaluate a handful of variants when they should be exploring thousands. And once a product is in operation, engineers lose the physics insight they had at design time, because the solvers behind it are too slow to keep up with live data.

We believe physics deserves its own frontier AI models. That's why we've brought Emmi AI into Mistral. In this post, we share what physics AI is, why it matters now, and what it makes possible for our partners like ASML, Airbus, Safran, and Siemens Energy.

We are building out a new foundational capability inside Mistral's enterprise solutions for AI-native industrial engineering—alongside our existing

,

, and the secure deployment and integration enterprises require.

Together they form a single stack spanning the engineering lifecycle: deployed where the customer needs it, integrated with their environment, fully under their control.

When running these “numerical physics simulations,” engineers use computers to predict how physical systems behave by solving partial differential equations. They are the language of physics: they describe how fluids flow, how structures deform, how heat moves. Rather than building and testing every prototype in the real world, engineers solve the governing physics equations on a computer by dividing an object into millions of tiny pieces and calculating what happens at each one.

A typical CFD or FEM workload looks much the same in 2026 as it did in 2006: prepare CAD geometry, discretize it into a mesh, configure boundary conditions, queue the run on an HPC cluster, wait. The result is a workflow that is

taking

hours to weeks of compute time per design variant, and

HPC capacity, solver licenses and specialist expertise gate the number of simulations that are being run. True design-space exploration is mathematically possible but economically impossible at this cost and tempo.

The consequence is structural. Engineers iterate on a handful of designs when they should be exploring thousands. Many teams settle for "good enough" because "optimal" is unaffordable in compute and calendar time. Every downstream constraint—manufacturability, certification, cost—compounds in terms of time and cost.

Data-driven physics AI is a class of AI models that learn from physics solver outputs and predict physical behavior directly from geometry and boundary conditions, or even measurement data. It maps inputs to full physical fields in a single forward pass, on the order of seconds, on a single GPU.

A few clarifications about what physics AI

:

It is a step-change in throughput for the vast majority of design-loop iterations, with traditional solvers reserved for verification and edge cases.

The architectures, training objectives and evaluation regimes are fundamentally different.

The point of physics AI is geometric and parametric generalization – one model serving an entire design family, not one model per part.

Now that model architectures allow for industrial scale (see e.g. AB-UPT) and GPUs have become powerful and accessible enough to train and serve physics workloads at production economics, it is the right point to double down from a research and solutions perspective.

Once inference moves from hours to seconds, both the engineering and operation of products reorganize around what's suddenly possible.

This is about the

the car body, the wing, the chip package, the motor.

What becomes possible:

Thousands of design variants explored in the time a single simulation used to take

AI models that propose design candidates, not just evaluate them

Simulation earlier in the process and usable beyond specialists

What it delivers:

Better-performing products at the same development cost

Shorter time from concept to validated design

Fewer expensive surprises late in development

This is about

—the molds, dies, fixtures, and process settings that turn a design into a manufactured part. Tooling geometry, materials, and process parameters together determine quality, cost, and yield.

What becomes possible:

Thousands of tooling variants explored in the time a single simulation used to take

Tooling geometry and process parameters optimized together, not in sequence

Manufacturing defects predicted before any tool is cut

What it delivers:

Faster tool development

Higher yield and fewer scrapped parts

Shorter ramp-up to stable production

A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical asset—a turbine, a power grid, a battery, a chemical reactor—that mirrors its behavior.

What becomes possible:

Continuous physics predictions on live sensor data

Models that update in real time as the asset operates

What-if scenarios on running assets, without taking them offline

What it delivers:

Predictive maintenance before failures occur

Higher operational efficiency across the asset’s lifetime

Extended asset life and deferred capex on replacement

Physics AI is a horizontal capability with vertical impact. This is a non-exhaustive map of where it is creating immediate value:

external aerodynamics, structural analysis, thermal management, propulsion, aeroelasticity.

vehicle aerodynamics, crashworthiness, battery thermal management, motor design.

chip and package thermal analysis, signal and power integrity, data-center and rack cooling, lithography optics.

wind and gas turbine design, grid-equipment optimizations, reactor thermal-hydraulics, subsurface flow and reservoir simulation.

heat exchangers, pumps and compressors, electric motors, tooling design.

The same model class, retrained or fine-tuned on the relevant physics, transfers across these domains.

We believe that physics AI is most valuable when it composes with the rest of an engineering organization's AI stack. That is why we ship it as one capability inside Mistral's enterprise platform, alongside:

Language and multimodal reasoning

Model training and customization

AI workflow design, orchestration and monitoring

Unified AI productivity and coding agent

Private AI

And expert

to accelerate your AI-native transformation

We’re building the first fully integrated AI stack that rethinks traditional engineering workflows end-to-end: Engineers define the intent and verify outcomes - the stack executes in between. The result: manufacturers explore orders of magnitude more design candidates, build the next generation of products faster, and maintain continuous performance gains across operational assets at scale.

If you're building the next generation of aircraft, vehicles, energy systems or electronics—and you're tired of waiting on the solver—
